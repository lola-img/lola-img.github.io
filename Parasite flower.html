      <h5><li> In this game you play as a Young girl named Ari Yeong, who seems to live the same day over and over again. She wakes up, looks in her mirror, walks past her parents, gets on the public bus, and gets to class. Your job is to get her to school safely. But as the days pass the world around her becomes more distorted. This is because the people in her day to day life, don’t have good intentions. An example of this is the people on the bus each’ day’, making comments on Ari (such as a random man saying “Little girls always behave…and smell good.. so nice and sweet.. and innocent.” And other disturbing dialogue).</li> </h5>
      <h5><li> At the end of each ‘day’ we get Ari to school, and as the days pass we get greeted by her teacher. A middle aged man. He is  viewed with a bunny mask  a head instead if his actual face on the last ‘day’. He is a bad man, with very poor intentions towards Ari. But she must show up to school, because there’s nothing else she can do. </li> </h5>
