      <h5><li> In this game you play as a Young girl named Ari Yeong, who seems to live the same day over and over again. She wakes up, looks in her mirror, walks past her parents, gets on the public bus, and gets to class. Your job is to get her to school safely. But as the days pass the world around her becomes more distorted. This is because the people in her day to day life, don’t have good intentions. An example of this is the people on the bus each’ day’, making comments on Ari (such as a random man saying “Little girls always behave…and smell good.. so nice and sweet.. and innocent.” And other disturbing dialogue).</li> </h5>
      <h5><li> At the end of each ‘day’ we get Ari to school, and as the days pass we get greeted by her teacher. A middle aged man. He is  viewed with a bunny mask  a head instead if his actual face on the last ‘day’. He is a bad man, with very poor intentions towards Ari. But she must show up to school, because there’s nothing else she can do. </li> </h5>

    <h5><li> In the beginning when she first looks in her mirror it is completely normal, but as the days pass and her innocence slowly wilts away, her image in the mirror becomes more and more distorted. Stitches appear over her mouth (symbolizing how she is powerless to speak up) which attribute to the abuse she is experiencing from her teacher. Along with the mirror's reflection slowly deteriorating as time passes, so does the world around her; just in a differnet way. As the 'days' pass things around her becoming increasingly concerning about both her enviroment and the people around her. A murder is assumed to take place in one of the houses she walks by each morning, the other women on the bus have differnet dialog each 'day', progressivly becoming darker and darker. At first the women offer pity to Ari, others offer warnigs about hiding her apperance, while one in the corner fantasises about attempting. But as time passes the dialog changes. One girl crys about what "they did to her over and over again" (likely refering to being assulted by a group of people), others become terrified of what might happen to them--Another example is a girl panicking about how her mother will be upset with her for him ruining her clothes, since she hates red. This can be taken as abuse, bullying, or sexual assult. And all of this leads to one of the women hanging herself on the bus, which was at some point expected since the celing handles looked suspisiusly like a noose. </li> </h5>
