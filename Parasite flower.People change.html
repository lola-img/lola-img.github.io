    <title> Parasite Flower - People change with time </title>

    <h5><li> As mentioned prior, the other women on the bus have different dialog each 'day', progressively becoming darker and darker. At first the women offer pity to Ari, others offer warnings about hiding her appearance, while one in the corner fantasizes about attempting. But as time passes the dialog changes. One girl cries about what "they did to her over and over again" (likely referring to being assaulted by a group of people), others become terrified of what might happen to them--Another example is a girl panicking about how her mother will be upset with her for him ruining her clothes, since she hates red. This can be taken as abuse, bullying, or sexual assault. And all of this leads to one of the women hanging herself on the bus, which was at some point expected since the ceiling handles looked suspiciously like a noose. </li></h5>

    <h4> Family relations to change.</h4>
    <h5><li> Her father's face is never really seen (much like the other men in the game), only showing his mouth since his hair covers the rest. - Her family life isn’t good either. Her father is depicted sitting on the couch in the dark, only illuminated by the TV glow, with only the top of his body visible. This is because Ari views her father as ‘without legs’ (a visual metaphor for his neglect). Along with the mirror becoming distorted, her father does as well. Each day that passes her father becomes more and more overgrown with flowers—Parasite flowers—Until he can be found with his lower half gone, ripped away. He changes, just like her world of innocence. </li></h5>
    <h5><li> Her mother isn’t much better. Whenever Ari tries to talk to her the mother, she tells Ari “Go to school Ari.”, dismissing her situation. On the fourth ‘day’ (it’s not really a day since she’s stuck in a time loop) her mother is seen with an unidentifiable item, likely a blade, in her hand. The next ‘day’ her mother’s face is revealed, except her jaw is missing, and a red ‘parasitic’ flower blooms out of her mouth—Likely symbolism for how many of the women shown in this game are powerless to what’s happening around them. It almost feels as if her face has been forgotten, blending into the background of this dreaded time loop--Which is why I quoted an artist/song writer, "You don't remember what she looks like? Just make something up." Since it felt <em>very</em> familliar. </li></h5>
