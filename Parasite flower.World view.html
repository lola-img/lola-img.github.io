    <h5> As mentioned in the starting page the world Ari lives in gets slowly more and more infected as you (the viewer) plays the game. Thats what this page will be about. </h5>
      
    <h5><li> In the beginning when Art first looks in her mirror it is completely normal, but as the days pass and her innocence slowly wilts away, her image in the mirror becomes more and more distorted. Stitches appear over her mouth (symbolizing how she is powerless to speak up) which attribute to the abuse she is experiencing from her teacher. Along with the mirror's reflection slowly deteriorating as time passes, so does the world around her; just in a differnet way. As the 'days' pass things around her becoming increasingly concerning about both her enviroment and the people around her. A murder is assumed to take place in one of the houses she walks by each morning, on the fifth 'day' one of the buildings is revealed to be a love hotel, and at some point shadowy people watch her from allyways. Her eyes are realizing the ugly truth of the area that she's always known as home. </li> </h5>
