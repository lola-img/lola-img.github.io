    <h5><li> In the beginning when Art first looks in her mirror it is completely normal, but as the days pass and her innocence slowly wilts away, her image in the mirror becomes more and more distorted. Stitches appear over her mouth (symbolizing how she is powerless to speak up) which attribute to the abuse she is experiencing from her teacher. Along with the mirror's reflection slowly deteriorating as time passes, so does the world around her; just in a differnet way. As the 'days' pass things around her becoming increasingly concerning about both her enviroment and the people around her. A murder is assumed to take place in one of the houses she walks by each morning, the other women on the bus have differnet dialog each 'day', progressivly becoming darker and darker. At first the women offer pity to Ari, others offer warnigs about hiding her apperance, while one in the corner fantasises about attempting. But as time passes the dialog changes. One girl crys about what "they did to her over and over again" (likely refering to being assulted by a group of people), others become terrified of what might happen to them--Another example is a girl panicking about how her mother will be upset with her for him ruining her clothes, since she hates red. This can be taken as abuse, bullying, or sexual assult. And all of this leads to one of the women hanging herself on the bus, which was at some point expected since the celing handles looked suspisiusly like a noose. </li> </h5>
